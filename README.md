# Airflower
Airflower adds intelligent decision-making to Apache Airflow by capturing real-time metadata through listeners and sending it to an external brain via gRPC. The brain, equipped with analytical and rule engines, processes the data and sends decisions back to Airflow to optimize task execution dynamically.
